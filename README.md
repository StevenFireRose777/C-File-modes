# C-File-modes



The purpose of this C-program is to allow users to create a new text file that has 3 modes currently: "append", "delete", and "write"

Append = create files and allows user to type whatever they want into that file.
Delete = delete the file in the directory the user is currently
Write = Creates file (for now)
